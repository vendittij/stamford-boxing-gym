            <p>Stamford Boxing And Fitness, located right in the Glenbrook section of Stamford, offers a flexible fitness program that allows everyone from different fitness levels to join without ever feeling left out. Our workouts are always fun but still challenging and allows  you to either push yourself harder each time or by going at your own pace. We offer a variety of classes here at Stamford Boxing And Fitness which includes Boxing Technique Classes, Cardio Boxing Classes, HIIT Classes, Strength And Conditioning Classes and Kids Classes. The variety of classes allows us to develop a weekly fitness program that will help you towards your personal fitness goal and keep you coming back for your next workout. In addition to our group classes, we allow open gym access for our members who would like to workout around our class schedule times.  



                Personal Training: We highly recommend private training sessions for anyone who prefers more privacy and willing to seek immediate results.  During our private training sessions, the trainer would be able to build up a positive relationship with you, which would allow us to get a better understanding of yourself, as well for your personal fitness goals.  We offer Boxing Lessons, Youth Training, Strength Training, Functional Training and Corrective Exercising. During your private training sessions, we also like to get a better understanding of your lifestyle outside of the gym which includes daily activities and meal consumption, which would allow us to make any recommendations, in order to help create or change your current lifestyle which may prevent you from achieving any of your personal goals.   
                
                
                
                Group Fitness Classes: Stamford Boxing And Fitness offers a variety of group classes which helps keep you motivated without feeling bored of the same old workout and creates a challenge which not only will benefit you physically by seeing positive results but also mentally once you realized how far you can push yourself in a workout, without giving up. 
                
                
                
                Why choose a fitness program? Whether you prefer Personal Training or Group Fitness Classes. It is very important to follow a fitness program which will not only guarantee positive results but also keep you committed to your personal fitness goals by following a proper guideline from a fitness professional who provides a safe and effective workout, proper guidance and effective nutritional advice. Some of the biggest reasons why people give up during a fitness program, includes lack of motivation, injury during workout, not seeing results on time and not having enough time to workout. That's why choosing the right trainer and an effective fitness program is important and we prioritize on safety, proper guidance and a flexible schedule whether it would be the group classes or through private training, in order to help you stay on track and reach your goals.</p>
